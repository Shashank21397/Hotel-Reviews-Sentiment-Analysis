# 🏨 Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analysis  

An **AI-powered Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analysis Dashboard** built using **Streamlit** and **RoBERTa Transformer** (a deep learning model for Natural Language Processing).  
This project analyzes hotel customer reviews and classifies them as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**, helping hotel managers quickly understand guest satisfaction trends.

## 🧠 How It Works  

This app uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** powered by a **Transformer-based AI model** from Hugging Face:  
[`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)

| Technology | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **AI / Deep Learning** | Transformer (RoBERTa) model trained on millions of human-written texts |
| **ML Concepts Used** | Text preprocessing, vectorization, contextual classification |
| **Frontend Framework** | Streamlit |
| **Visualization** | Plotly |

In simple terms — your model doesn’t just look for keywords; it **understands the meaning and emotion behind the words**, like a human.
